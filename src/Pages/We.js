                        <p>The Student Intern program is a structured and guided work-based learning program for students currently enrolled in India.



                            There is a small registration fee, INR 400 /- (RUPEES Four HUNDRED ONLY) applicable to all incoming interns  as part of this One-of-a-Kind Point based Program.
