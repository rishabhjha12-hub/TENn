              <p>I thoroughly enjoyed my internship during this pandemic situation and gained valuable experience under my belt. I know this internship will be instrumental in getting myself a job and it would be glowing reference on my CV. I was very hesitant at the time of joining TEN due to my inexperience, but now I feel so happy that I was able to be a part of it as it has made me so much more confident and empowered. As much as this organization changes, I hope that itâ€™s class remains constant.

                Thank you team TEN!

              <p>TEN was my first ever experience into internship. Even though I didn't have much of an idea about my responsibilities, my mentors at TEN and fellow colleagues helped me a lot in making me understand my roles and were very cooperative throughout.
